README:

This file contains the user instructions for the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) Algorithm by Bryan A. Tolson.  
DDS is an n-dimensional, heuristic, probabilistic global optimization algorithm for continuous/discrete/mixed 
decision-variable, box-constrained (bound-constrained) optimization problems.  
DDS is designed to find good solutions quickly and requires no algorithm parameter tuning.
